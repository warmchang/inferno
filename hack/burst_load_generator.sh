# Burst Load Generator Script
# Keep in sync with test/e2e/fixtures/scripts/burst_load_generator.sh (e2e embeds that copy).
#
# This script generates burst load by sending requests in parallel batches with sleep between batches.
# This creates queue spikes that are more likely to trigger saturation detection.
#
# Environment Variables:
#   TOTAL_REQUESTS: Total number of requests to send
#   BATCH_SIZE: Number of requests to send in parallel per batch
#   CURL_TIMEOUT: Timeout for each curl request (seconds)
#   MAX_TOKENS: Maximum tokens for each request
#   BATCH_SLEEP: Sleep duration between batches (seconds)
#   MODEL_ID: Model ID to use in requests
#   TARGET_URL: Target URL for requests (e.g., http://service:port/v1/chat/completions)
